# How is this repository used?

The IAMbic GitHub Application generates Plan and Apply Summaries for each pull request in your IAMbic templates repository. These summaries provide an overview of the changes proposed by a pull request, and the results of applying those changes. The IAMbic Github Application stores these summaries in a separate repository to allow for easier tracking and management, and as it adds comments in each pull request, it provides a link to the summary in this separate repository.
